# CLRInjector
A bootstrapper dll that loads your assemblies into a process' existing CLR instance


## Abandoned

Completely forgot about this. No idea how much of it is functional, too lazy to check. I'm certain I got the mono loader and .NET framework loader working, but only 80% certain I got .NET core working. This was also years ago (oct 2021 was last code change - commit date is wrong) so the .NET framework and core versions might've changed so much that this no longer compiles. No clue! Good luck to anyone that stumbles upon this and needs to make use of it.
